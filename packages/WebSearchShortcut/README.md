### Example

```json
{
  "Google": {
    "Url": "https://www.google.com/search?q=%s",
    "SuggestionProvider": "Google"
  },
  "Bing": {
    "Url": "https://www.bing.com/search?q=%s",
    "SuggestionProvider": "Bing"
  },
  "GitHub": {
    "Url": "https://www.github.com/search?q=%s"
  },
  "GitHubStars": {
    "Url": "https://github.com/stars?q=%s",
    "Keyword": "gs"
  },
  "StackOverflow": {
    "Url": "https://stackoverflow.com/search?q=%s",
    "Keyword": "st"
  },
  "npm": {
    "Url": "https://www.npmjs.com/search?q=%s"
  },
  "YouTube": {
    "Url": "https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%s",
    "Keyword": "yt"
  },
  "ChatGPT": {
    "Url": "https://chat.openai.com/?q=%s",
    "Keyword": "gpt"
  }
}
```

## Configuration fields

### `Url`

The URL template for performing the search. Use `%s` as a placeholder for the search query. If the URL does not contain `%s`, the URL will be opened directly when you press enter.

```json
{
  "Google": {
    "Url": "https://www.google.com/search?q=%s"
  }
}
```

> **Note**: To use multiple URLs, you can separate them with a space (" ").
> For example:
>
> ```json
> {
>   "GoogleAndBing": {
>     "Url": "https://www.google.com/search?q=%s https://www.bing.com/search?q=%s"
>   }
> }
> ```
>
> Alternatively, you can use an array of URLs with the [`Urls`](#urls) field.

### `Urls`

`Urls` is an alias for [`Url`](#url), supporting the setting of multiple URLs in an array format.

```json
{
  "GoogleAndBing": {
    "Urls": ["https://www.google.com/search?q=%s", "https://www.bing.com/search?q=%s"]
  }
}
```

### `Keyword`

Used to quickly select the target search engine using a short keyword.

```json
{
  "Google": {
    "Url": "https://www.google.com/search?q=%s",
    "Keyword": "g"
  }
}
```

### `IconUrl`

You can customize the icon by setting this field. Under normal circumstances, you don't need to set this, as the plugin will automatically download the favicon of the website corresponding to the [`Url`](#url) field. However, sometimes you might want to customize the icon, and this field comes in handy.

> **Note**: This field can only be set to a network URL and cannot be set to a local file.

### `IsDefault`

If this option is `true`, the corresponding search engine does not need to input the trigger word.

### `ReplaceWhitespace`

With `ReplaceWhitespace`, you can specify which character(s) to replace a space with when performing a search. This is useful for some websites, such as Wikipedia, which don't use plus signs ("+") to separate words in the URL.

| Value         | Result             |
|---------------|--------------------|
| `" "` or `""` | `Example+search`   |
| `"-"`         | `Example-search`   |
| `"_"`         | `Example_search`   |
| `"+"`         | `Example%2Bsearch` |

> **Note**: As the string is converted to a URL, any spaces in the string (or `ReplaceWhitespace`) will be replaced with plus signs. Any other characters that are not allowed in a URL will be encoded with [percent-encoding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Percent-encoding).

### `SuggestionProvider`

Used to set the search suggestion provider.

**The currently supported search suggestion providers are:**

- `Google`
- `Bing`
- `npm`
- `CanIUse`

PRs welcome!

> You can also set a Provider to another search engine.
> For example:
>
> ```json
> {
>   "StackOverflow": {
>     "Url": "https://stackoverflow.com/search?q=%s",
>     "SuggestionProvider": "Google"
>   }
> }
> ```
